## Mana drops

Mana drops are an important feature of the Druid-plattform. Mana gets dropped **every 7 days after you redeemed the last drop**
You will receive an email if a new drop is available.

The amount of the the drop will allways be **the amount missing to fill you back up to 1000 Mana** at the time, the drop is created, so it is recommended to redeem the drop as fast as possible, to get the next 7 days started and not to miss our on Mana.

### Examples

- You have 300 Mana left, since you redeemed the last drop and 7 days are past.
  - You will receive 700 Mana.
- You have not touched your Mana since your last drop was redeemed and your Mana is at 1000.
  - You will not receive any Mana, until you spend some
- You spend all your Mana in 4 days after you redeemed your last drop.
  - Your deployments will expire, before you receive the next drop.
