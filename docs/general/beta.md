## Mana Drops

Mana drops are an important feature of the druid platform. Mana drops occur **every 7 days after the last drop was redeemed**.
You will receive an email when a new drop is available.

The amount of the drop will always be **the amount missing to fill you back up to 1000 mana** at the time the drop is created, so it is recommended to redeem the drop as soon as possible to get the next 7 days started and not miss our on mana.

### Examples

- You have 300 mana left after redeeming the last drop and 7 days have passed.
  - You receive 700 mana.
- You have not touched your mana since you redeemed your last drop and your mana is 1000.
  - You receive no mana until you spend some.
- You spend all your mana within 4 days of redeeming your last drop.
  - Your supplies will expire before you receive your next drop.
