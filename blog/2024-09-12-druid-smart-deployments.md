# Druid Smart Deployments Out Now for Minecraft!

## What are Druid Smart Deployments?

We are excited to announce that our Druid Smart Deployments are now available for Minecraft!

Our Druid Smart Deployments give you and us a significant advantage over other providers. You only pay Mana when someone is actually playing on your server. If no one is connected to your server, it goes into Sleepmode, consuming only a tiny fraction of the resources and in turn only a fraction of your Mana.

Once someone connects to your server, the magic of Druid Smart Deployments begins! The server starts automatically, and players can connect in less than a minute. In the coming weeks, we will assess how this technology performs in a live environment and expand it to more games over time.

With this technology, we can competitively enter the market and offer a unique selling point (USP).
